//Example: Calculate the area of a rectangle given the width and height of the rectangle.

//Calculate the Area of a Rectangle - Functions, Arguments, Parameters, and Returning Values.

function calculateArea(width, height){  //Width = 5 and height = 6 (Parameter 1 and 2)


    var area = width * height;          //Assign variable area to calculate width x height.
    console.log("The Area of the Rectangle is " + area);  //Result to print from function.
}

//This is considered invoking your function:
calculateArea(5,6); //Print console.log from function to invoke. Assigns argument 1 and 2 into function.





//function calculateArea(w, h);
 //   return w * h;
